The project uses a single PostgreSQL database for all services, a single monolithic backend app (with potential to split into microservices later), and Flutter for the front end.


all project planning and task update must be done and tracked from within `project/plan` and `project/tasks` 

no source code should be > 500 lines of code (excluding imports, code comments and inline tests), if it exceeds the code file should be refactored on first chance according to SOLID  principles.
