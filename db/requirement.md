based on this requirement, assume I have a monolith api server in one container which provides all apis but the monolith is written in a way that the apis can be segregated based on micro-service concept at a later stage and can run in individual containers, I only have postgresql database. Now assume you are a database expert and create the table structure for this system which supports auditing and loose coupling, make use of industry best practices. create the structure with names of tables in a way that later the tables can be moved it its own logical space based on feature separations. the example is billing related tables can be kept in one database later and also product related table can be kept in another database. the customer PII data can also be kept in a separate database. for now I want everything in one database but table structure should allow isolation later. I only need postgresql script as a starter for now.
